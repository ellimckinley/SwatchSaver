# SwatchSaver Color Pallete Generator

![Logo](./assets/images/swatchsaverlogo.png)


SwatchSaver is a web app to allow users to quickly make, save, and mange color palettes. Built using Tailwind CSS and JavaScript, the app allows users to generate adjustable sized color palettes, preview them in dynamically generated sections, and tweak/reroll individual HEX colors. Our aim is to give designers, devs, and artists a tool to create quick and intuitive color combinations with a clean and simple environment.


**Our Why**
- Existing palette creation tools are overly complicated and have tons of unnecessary features. Many platforms hide functionality behind paywalls which is really annoying when you want to access a simple tool with simple features. 
- Creating a **Free** Solution: SwatchSaver was built to provide a clean, intuitive, accessible tool for anyone who wants to quickly create and manage color palettes

## User Story

As a user, 
I want to generate color palettes,
So that, I can experiment with different color combinations by locking, generating, and interact with different colors

## Lessons Learned

During our first Coding Bootcamp project, we gained valuable insights and skills. While the journey was challenging, our accomplishments were truly rewarding. Here are some key takeaways:

- **Mastering TailwindCSS:** Initially, TailwindCSS felt overwhelming, but once we overcame the learning curve, its flexibility and efficiency became apparent.

- **Good code layout is vital:** Managing large JavaScript files can quickly become overwhelming without proper organization. A clear and consistent structure is essential for maintainability.

- **Collaborative Git Practices:** Using GitHub for team collaboration was a new experience for all of us. We learned the importance of communication and version control in a shared coding environment.
